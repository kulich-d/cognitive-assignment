           2) Additionally, assess and determine the primary purpose of the advertisement, i.e. whether it is aimed at brand building or aimed at driving conversion."

The attention heatmap illustrates the distribution of attention as predicted by an AI model that was trained on eye-tracking data. Red colour indicates high attention, green implies moderate level and transparent colours mean low attention. Please do not confuse the heatmap colours, i.e. the red, yellow, green blobs etc. with the actual colours of the video frames"

    Based on the provided heatmap, identify the most visually salient elements, i.e. the elements that catch the most attention.

Assess the perceptual or cognitive load of the image. This is a measure of the effort required for mental processing based on the visual complexity, such as diversity of colours, presence of patterns and the inclusion of text. In other words, assess how accessible the image will be to a viewer in terms of the brain processing capacity required to interpret and understand the advertisement."
